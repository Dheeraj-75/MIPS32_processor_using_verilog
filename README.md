This project involves the design and implementation of a 32-bit MIPS processor using Verilog HDL, capable of executing a subset of the MIPS32 instruction set. 
The processor employs a single-cycle architecture, integrating essential components such as the ALU, control unit, register file, and memory interface to support arithmetic, logic, load/store, branch, and jump operations. 
The design emphasizes clarity and modularity, with a hierarchical structure that allows easy expansion or modification of instruction support.
Comprehensive testbenches are provided to simulate and verify the processorâ€™s functionality, including example assembly programs to demonstrate instruction execution and correct data flow.
The implementation also incorporates principles of pipelining and hazard management, providing practical exposure to performance optimization in processor design. 
This repository includes all source files, simulation scripts, and detailed documentation covering the data path, control logic, timing diagrams, and block-level architecture, making it a complete educational reference for learning and experimenting with processor design using Verilog HDL.
